# belenios-preferential-vote

This repository contains several User Interface components meant to be used in [Belenios](https://www.belenios.org/), for preferential vote. They are implemented using Javascript ES6 and React (without JSX nor transpilation), and (will) use i18next for internationalisation.

[Here is a demo](https://swergas.github.io/belenios-preferential-vote/index_with_cdn.html) of a vote User Interface which uses these components.
